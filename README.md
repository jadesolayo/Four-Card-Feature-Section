## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-First workflow


### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a better understanding of CSS grids and CSS flexbox properties. I alsplearnt how to postion elements in the center using the align-self property. I also learnt how to use the text-align property to position elements.

Here are some snippets of code that helped me during the course of this project:
```html
      <section class="main"></section>
```
```css
.main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  margin-top: 50px;
  gap: 25px;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to work with more css grids as I hard time trying to create this layout with it. Working with css grids helped with the layouts as i was able to map out the layout with just grid columns.
